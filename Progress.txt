Goals
1.  Ask and identify situations
  
2.  Call the correct class and give general equation for the physics situation 

3.  Ask for which variable to solve and print the solved equation as well as the answer

4.  Add on the most common Physics problems and work to expand once that goal is met




Status

1.  Main function asking for situations

2.  3 situations as of now. We have 4 but the 4th was uploaded last minute and we were unable to check it
    a. 2 situations working fully and the 3rd only has a small issue with the final out
3.  Solves for one variable at a time

4.  Can be used to solve for items such as gravity and friction if needed
5.  Files standardized using similar methods as well as an interface
